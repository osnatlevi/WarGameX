# War Game IOS


This is a simple card game iOS application written in SwiftUI. The game involves two players, a user and a computer, who compete against each other by flipping cards and comparing their values. The player with the higher card value earns a point. The game continues for ten rounds, after which the final scores are displayed, and a winner is declared.

## Functionality

Presents an alert where the user can enter their name. The name must consist of alphabetic characters only and cannot be empty.
Saves the user's name using UserDefaults for future sessions.
Displays image indicating the left or right side of default location from current location, determining the player's position in the game.
