## About
This is a simple card game iOS application written in SwiftUI. The game involves two players, a user and a computer, who compete against each other by flipping cards and comparing their values. The player with the higher card value earns a point. The game continues for ten rounds, after which the final scores are displayed, and a winner is declared.

>- Saves the user's name using UserDefaults for future sessions.
